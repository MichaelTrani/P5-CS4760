NOTE
	This program is pretty solid.
	It will not process statistics, I didn't get that far.
	I developed a few ideas to develop and test more efficiently.
	First is a bash script for cleaning out lingering ipc addresses. I was proud of that.
	The second was attempting to easily convert my comments to output statements to find points of hangup faster. That was a disaster and I do not recommend it.
	Deadlock avoidance is glued together by hopes and dreams so it performs as such. I don't know if it's even running sometimes.
	
	Requests, releases, and termination  work properly.
	Verbose mode works.
	Blocking denied requests works.
	As does unblocking and the safety algorithm.
